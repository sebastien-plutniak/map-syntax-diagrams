MAP syntax diagrams is an R Shiny [application](https://splutniak.shinyapps.io/syntax-diagram) to study Ancient divine onomastic sequences. It relies on the format used in the framework of the “[Mapping Ancient Polytheisms](https://map-polytheisms.huma-num.fr)” project to represent these sequences and describe the semantic relationships between their elements (names of gods, qualifications, etc.). The application allows to model the sequences as graphs, visualised them, characterise and compare them using several metrics.
